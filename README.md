# Vanderbilt Run Club Web Application
The client for the project is the Vanderbilt Run Club and the project itself is a web
application for the club to collect and report information in one standard location. For
background, the run club at Vanderbilt meets 5 days per week from 4:30-5:30 pm to
hold running practices in the Vanderbilt area. The main portion of this project will be to
create a search-able archive of running routes endorsed by the running club. Users of
the application will be able to input runs, tagging the route's main characteristics, so that
others can search for runs in the area.
